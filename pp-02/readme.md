## ITMD 362, Production Problem 02: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site
Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Before you start, be sure to read through the color theory readings on the course calendar for Week
Four.

Once you’ve read, you’ll choose a palette based on each prompt below, and paste the Paletton URL in
with your chosen palette (you’ll see that the `uid` value in the Paletton URL changes with each
adjustment that you make). Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the colors you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode “Default with Text,” so you can see how text looks on each palette
you choose. Use the Preview tab at the bottom of the palette preview.

1. A **monochromatic color palette** for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=11r0u0knbuhtjm3suszjvzif3HP
Your Rationale: For something new and hoping to rise, I want to evoke pleasant, optimistic feelings
for the reader. This is why a chose yellow which evokes this.

2. An **adjacent color palette** for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=52g0u0k++sPQzZA+VFP+Xn8+yh8
Your Rationale: Nature is often associated with the color green which represents the gardens. Yellow 
is a bright color that evokes happiness and may remind people of the sun. Purple would be a good 
color for spring but its adjacents 
are not great for this.

3. A **triadic color palette** for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=35C1m0k++vqF+ZD+VQc+Xpp+pjn
Your Rationale: The colors are the primary colors. They are basic for them and hopeful evoke 
happiness and passion for learning while keeping them calm.

4. A **custom color palette** for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=30u0D0kLcwopfJbyOJSMDpMOWjS
Your Rationale: With cybersecurity, I want to promote a calmer mind with the cool colors. The blue
is meant to evoke responsibility. Green is to promote growth and learning and orange is for the
creativity in overcoming challenges.
