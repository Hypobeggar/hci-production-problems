## ITMD 362, Production Problem 05: Usability Checklists

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability
problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is
to locate at least 2 different usability checklists of at least 25 items (use Google, but challenge
yourself to go beyond the first page of results).

From those lists, create your own, condensed list of exactly ten items **that are relevant to your
teams’s interface from Project Two**.

Finally, I highly encourage you to work on this Production Problem with your team for Project
Two/Three to help yourselves create your own master usability checklist, and smooth the way forward
for your first (and second) round of usability testing.

## Deliverables

* URLs for the usability checklists you’ve found:

1. https://internetdevels.com/blog/50-point-checklist-for-website-usability-testing
2. https://web.wsu.edu/2015/07/15/website-usability-checklist/

* Your team’s condensed ten-item, must-have usability checklist:

1.  Terms or labels are mutually exclusive, especially in navigation
(terms not redundant or confusing)
2. Related topics are located together
3. Font size is legible
4. The user’s current location is always identified
5. Page layout is clear with a sufficient amount of white space
6. Users usually expect that your site’s main logo will link to your homepage, so make sure you’ve done this
7. If the form you’ve created is too long, split up it in a few pages. The goal is to make it as plain as possible.
8. Every color has the meaning behind; it may be “Confirm”, “Cancel”, “Delete” or others.
9. Are your fonts readable? Make your text easy to read by avoiding small font sizes and sophisticated types of fonts.
10. Instructions written on the buttons and menu should be short and direct.
