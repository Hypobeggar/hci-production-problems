  <h1>Font 1: Merriweather</h1>
  <p id="Merri">
    Merriweather is a typeface that I like and decided to find a pairing for. In this pairing I
    would use Merriweather for the body although either could be used for it. Merriweather looks
     less standard than Noto Serif making it a nice change for headings of certain media. It's also
     easier to read.
  </p>
  <h2>Font 2: Noto Serif</h2>
  <p id="Noto">
    Noto was chosen as a pairing as apart of the "Seek the Similar" strategy. The two fonts are
    similar with some differences that can be noticed by a keen eye. Noto Serif has a somewhat
    standard look and can lead to lose of attention in longer bodies of text.
